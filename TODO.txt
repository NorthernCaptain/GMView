This is the TODO file for Knowhere project by Leonid Khramov, design by Igor Khramov.

TODO list:

* 30.10.09 *
- Problem with GPS/COM connection indicators, its show incorrect status. Also after fixes, move 
  them to the GPS info dashboard (top left corner) and make it flash a little if in a proper status.
  
- GPSTrack - add average speed calculation from previous waypoint, not only from start. Add this 
  information to the GPS info dashboard + distance from last WP. May be move this info to the Track
  dashboard?? So we need info about last waypoint: Time till WP, distance from WP, average speed 
  from WP. It's better to organize in the WayBase class and calculate for each WP recently added.
  
- Add altitute to the GPS dashboard.

- Follow track mode. Add estimated time calculation to the nearest point and to the finish point.
  Take average speed from the recording track. [DONE 02.11.09]
  
- Reassing F1 hotkey and implement Keys Help page for display hotkeys and actions, also there could
  be second page with description of the toolbar buttons and menus.
  We need help system :)
  
- Import track from clipboard buffer. Add Paste function that will paste data from clipboard and 
  loads it as a track, show on the map.

- Save track redesign. When we hit Record track, display dialog with From and Destination 
  text fields. Create and auto save this track into file 'From-Destination-YY-MM-DD.gpõ' into
  tracks directory.
  Think about continuing of autosaved track if we crashed and restarted.
  
- Load track dialog redesign. Merge file choosing dialog with track color assign dialog and add 
  new tab about track loading options. Options include - loading POI or not, merge multiple tracks
  if they are in the file and more.
  
- Points of interest (bookmarks). Complete refactoring and redesing.
  * Add more fields to the POI: POI type, short name, descriprion, comments, tags, group, show_in_menu
  * Look for standart list of POI types, maybe from Google KML of GPX standards.
  * Different icons for different types - need library of icons.... + multiPOI type and icon.
  * Put POIs into database SQLite with indexing and RTree spatial search.
  * Quick Add POI for current position. Display dialog with most common types of POIs. User choose
    just type, then we create POI on the current position with this type, generaged name and mark it as
    "Partially defined". Later user can edit it and define the rest of the data. +Mark this point on
    the track as we already did.
  * Refactor "display POIs on the screen" method. Do it in separate thread, load from database by
    a region, merge nearest into one multiPOI, then display prepared data on the screen in main
    thread.
  * Quick POI search toolbar. Type name or type of the POI (just first letters) and see dropdown
    list of the POIs nearest to current location. Quickly change range of searching.
    Range of searching calculates according user preferences and current zoom level.
  * Edit POIs dialog with grid, search header by different fields and region. Tree view for groups
    hierarchy. Edit or delete POIs with multiselection mode. Managing groups (add, delete, edit).
  * Importing POIs from external files (KML, GPX), dialog for matching POI fields from file to our
    internal fields, choosing or changing types and more.
